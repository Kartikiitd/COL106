## Document Processing Tool

# Overview
- We are given a big document and certain queries.
- We process the document and store the frequency of all words in it. For this we are creating a Dictionary .
- Our Dictionary is a height balanced tree (AVL tree) .
- For the Search part we are given some part of the document and we need to return the linked list .
- For Searching we use Rabin Karp Algorithm 
- Every node of linked list contains details like book id , page no. , paragraph no. ,sentence no. etc.
