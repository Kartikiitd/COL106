## Hashing Implementation

# Overview
- This project focusses on implementation of different types of hashing techniques like chaining  and probing.
- In this project we create a prototype of banking system where we have unique bank ids for everyone
- We maintain the database using hashing techniques
- Later we perform certain set of queries like adding transactions, creating new accounts, deleting old accounts, top customers retrieval etc.
- So we use different hashing techniques to optimise the time complexity and deal with collision handling.
