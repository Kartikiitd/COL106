## Compiler for Simple Language of Expressions

# Overview
- We are given an expression to evaluate . For that we process the text.
- After processing the text we create an AVL tree where root is a symbol
- the keys of tree nodes are either symblols are values .
- after creating the tree according to the specifications we generate the code for its evaluation
- For the purpose of evaluation we push the opertions in a stack machine corresponding the key of node
- Now we calculate the answer using the stack machine which has certain set of operations
